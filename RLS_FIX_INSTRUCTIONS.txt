CRITICAL: RLS POLICIES FIX REQUIRED

The course page and session pages are not loading because of RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of FIX_RLS_COMPREHENSIVE.sql
5. Paste it into the SQL editor
6. Click "Run"
7. Wait for "Success" message
8. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
9. Try accessing the course page again

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Course summary page will load
- Session detail pages will load
- Attendance counts will update in real-time
- Lecturers can see all their sessions (active and completed)
- All database queries will work properly

IF YOU GET AN ERROR:
- The error message will tell you which policy already exists
- That's OK - it means the fix is partially applied
- Try running the query again - it should complete successfully

AFTER THE FIX:
- All pages should load instantly
- Real-time updates will work
- No more loading spinners
- Everything will be connected to the database
